# Neovim Config

## What is this?

This is a live track of my Neovim config and how it improves over time.

## Disclosure

This config works seamlessly out of the box. However, I **HIGHLY** recommend against using it unless you are **AWARE** of what you are doing.

Neovim configuration is a beautiful journey, so make sure to learn how to do it yourself—that is the skill that counts. It's also a good break from the headaches of programming ;)

## How to make it work

1. **Neovim Version:** You need Neovim 0.11+.
2. **Fonts:** You need a Nerd Font. You can download one [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
   * Personally, I recommend [JetBrains Mono](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono).
   * Here is an [article](https://medium.com/@almatins/install-nerdfont-or-any-fonts-using-the-command-line-in-debian-or-other-linux-f3067918a88c) on how to install them on Linux.
3. **Installation:** Place the `nvim` directory under `~/.config/` and run `nvim`.

```bash
# Example
git clone https://github.com/MohamedElDegwi/NeovimConfig.git ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```
